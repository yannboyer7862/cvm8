This is the repository of CVM8.





A very basic Chip8 Virtual Machine written in C++ with SDL2 and SDL2_Mixer !




Builds instructions might be added in the future, not sure tho, as this is a very basic project.



Note : The keyboard input isn't implemented, and I don't plan to.

I just wanted to have a VM that could run the programs and that's it.
